                <h3>Guidance Navigation and Control Engineer</h3>
                <p>
                <b>[BIO]:</b> As a passionate reader of science-fiction and fantasy literature, I hold a special place in my heart for <i>Speaker for the Dead</i>, by Orson Scott. My interests extend to the domains of science and engineering, with a particular emphasis on the technical hurdles associated with control and safety of spacecrafts. When not pursuing my professional interests, I enjoy playing my favorite songs on the guitar and piano, and indulging in outdoor activities such as climbing and scuba diving. I was born in Barcelona, Catalonia; now I am out in the wild.

                <h3>Visiting Scholar</h3>
                <p>
                Over the course of five months, I had the privilege of visiting <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=PNt4Y1kAAAAJ">Prof. John Crassidis</a>, a distinguished expert in spacecraft attitude control and space situational awareness (SSA), as well as a former NASA employee, at his home university. During this time, he provided me with invaluable guidance and mentorship. Our collaboration yielded the development of a novel and effective methodology to estimate unknown spacecraft impulsive maneuvers, both in Earth-bounded orbits and cislunar (L2) space. This journey not only expanded my understanding on SSA but also allowed me to contribute to the advancement of this field alongside an admired mentor.

                <h2>Control and Automation</h2>
                <h3>PhD Fellow</h3>
                <p>
                I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in the Department of Control and Automation at Aalborg University, with <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uoH_txQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra">Prof. Rafal Wisniewski</a> as my advisor. My main focus is on spacecraft safety &mdash;particularly collision probability assessment and collision avoidance maneuvers. Nonetheless, my interest and contributions extends to other space projects, including co-authoring a paper on the control strategy for the pointing acquisition of the LISA mission, as well as actively participating in the construction and control design of a Rover, for the 2023 European Rover Challenge, as part of the AAU Space Robotics team. Additionally, I have become a member of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.en.space.aau.dk/aau-space-group">AAU Space Group</a>, which connects researchers with strong interdisciplinary skills in space-related research, and supervised multiple Master's thesis related to spacecraft GNC. My diverse experiences and abilities make me a highly motivated and rigurous researcher, ready to contribute to advanced space exploration and technology.

                <h3>Master's Student</h3>
                <p>
                I pursued my Master's degree in Control and Automation in Denmark. This education based on <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem-based_learning">Problem-Based Learning (PBL)</a> highly complemented my previous&mdash;rather traditional&mdash;education, in which more emphasis was placed into individual learning of theoretical knowledge. PBL helped me enhance my critical assessment and retrieval skills of the state-of-the-art, as well as my teamwork aptitudes as I had the opportunity to engage in multi-cultural and multi-disciplinary cooperation with fellow students and real companies, broadening my perspectives and fostering a collaborative mindset. A significant example of this is our (my colleagues and I) cooperation with the renowned Danish company Novo Nordisk A/S, developing titration control and fault-tolerant algorithms for patients with Type 2 Diabetes.

                <p>
                More aligned with my personal research interest lies the expertise I acquired in spacecraft dynamics and control. Aalborg university has a strong background in spacecraft engineering, having launched 5 student-built Cubesats since 2003 and mentored students who later founded two prominent spacecraft builder companies. Leveraging the expertise gained throughout my education (see <a href="projects.html")>Space Projects</a>), I dedicated my final thesis to studying the intricate problem of rendezvous and docking of Cubesats, obtaining the highest grade.

                Supervised by <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=toC9J6YAAAAJ">Prof. Anders la Cour-Harbo</a>, my main responsibilities included designing and conducting lab and air-borne tests, organizing and supporting specialized location tests such as military bases, analyzing vibration data from IMU sensors and VICON motion capture, and devising an emergency decision method for drone landing determination which yielded two academic papers (see <a href="projects-drones.html">Drone Projects</a>).
